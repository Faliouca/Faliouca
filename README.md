# Hi there!

<!--
**Faliouca/Faliouca** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

<p>ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on little stories and all that.
<br>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to write stories!
<br>ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on... nothing really? Maybe collab adopts but really nothing.
<br>ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Toyhou.se CSS! It's a real hard thing.
<br>ðŸ’¬ Ask me about art in general.
<br>ðŸ“« How to reach me: Twitter, @faliouca
<br>ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/They
<br>âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a STUPID LIL GIRL!</p>


<p>All I ask for is respect, not to yell at me for doing something wrong.</p>

### Choice

<p>Love, brain, heart control,
<br>Caffeinate!
<br>Melatonin...
<br>Love, heart control,
<br>Caffeinate!
<br>You get me going-
<br>Brain, heart control,
<br>Caffeinate!
<br>Melatonin...
<br>Love, brain, heart-
<br>Wake up!
<br>*Smack!*</p>

<p>"Nice to meet ya,
<br>Who could you be?"
<br>"I AM INJURY!"
<br>"No, you aren't!
<br>You made the choice to be!"
<br>"But I am!"
<br>"No!"
<br>"I am!"
<br>"No!"</p>

Dopamine, eh...
